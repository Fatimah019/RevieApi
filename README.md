# Question :

Revie is a hypothetical platform where users can sign up with their basic information and post reviews about apartments they've previously lived in. These reviews can include optional videos and/or images. The users can give reviews about the landlords, the environment the apartment is situated, and the quality of amenities in the apartment. These reviews can be uniquely marked as helpful by random visitors of the platform. Visitors can also sort these reviews based on the most helpful(by count) or most recent.
